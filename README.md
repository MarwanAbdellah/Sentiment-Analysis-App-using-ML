# Sentiment Analysis App Using Machine Learning

This is a machine learning-based sentiment analysis web application built using **Streamlit**. The app allows users to input text reviews and classifies the sentiment as either **Positive** or **Negative**. The sentiment classification is powered by a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Enter your review or feedback text in the provided input field.
- **Sentiment Prediction**: The app predicts if the sentiment of the review is **Positive** or **Negative**.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The app uses a pre-trained model and vectorizer for text processing and sentiment classification.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The application utilizes NLP techniques for tokenization, stopword removal, and other preprocessing tasks using **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit).

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A Python framework for building interactive web apps.
- **Pickle**: For serializing and loading machine learning models and vectorizers.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text preprocessing such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training and prediction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
